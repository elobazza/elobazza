### âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub profile âœ¨

Hey there! I'm EloÃ­sa, a Software Engineering graduate from the State University of Santa Catarina, currently diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with my postgraduate studies at PUC Minas. I'm passionate about a lot of things, including art, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, books, and music. When I'm not coding or studying, you can usually find me exploring a new book, enjoying some music, or stargazing. Always on the lookout for new ideas and inspiration! ðŸ”­
